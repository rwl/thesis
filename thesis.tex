\begin{abstract}
Connectionist reinforcement learning methods approximating value-functions
offer few convergence guarantees, even in simple systems.  Reinforcement
learning has been applied previously to agent-based simulation of energy
markets using only discrete action and sensor domains. If learning algorithms
are to deliver on their potential for application in operational settings,
modelling continuous domains is necessary.  The contribution of this thesis is
to show that policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithms can be applied
to continuous representations of energy trading problems and that their
superior use of sensor data results in improved performance over previously
applied value-function methods.  From this it follows that algorithms which
search directly in the policy space will be better suited to decision support
applications and automated energy trade.
